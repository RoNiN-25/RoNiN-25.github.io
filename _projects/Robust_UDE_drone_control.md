This project investigates the design and implementation of a **robust control architecture** for a quadrotor drone using the **Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE)** approach. The goal was to achieve stable flight and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of **model uncertainties** and **external disturbances**.

We used a **PlutoX quadrotor** equipped with an **ESP32** controller and integrated it with a **WhyCon marker-based localization system** for indoor tracking. The control framework was implemented using **MATLAB/Simulink** for simulation and **ROS**/**C++** for real-world deployment.


Traditional **PID-based controllers** often fail to deliver reliable performance when the drone dynamics are uncertain or when disturbances affect the system. To address this, we implemented a **UDE-based control strategy** that dynamically estimates the effects of disturbances and model inaccuracies and compensates for them in real-time.

Key features of the implementation:

* **Virtual force-based position control**: Computes a desired virtual force vector from the drone‚Äôs current state to the goal point, enabling intuitive 3D navigation.
* **UDE-based torque control**: Achieves robust control of the drone‚Äôs roll, pitch, and yaw angles even under model inaccuracies.
* **ROS-based integration**: Used **WhyCon markers** for precise position feedback and implemented real-time communication between the controller and drone.
* **Onboard implementation**: Developed a **C++-based UDE controller** using the **Cygnus IDE** and flashed it onto the STM32 microcontroller for faster attitude control.

Simulations were carried out in **MATLAB/Simulink** to validate the performance, followed by real-world testing. Results demonstrated that the **UDE controller significantly outperformed PID control**, achieving lower overshoot and better stability while successfully compensating for external disturbances.
